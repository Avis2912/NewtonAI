Traditional experimental and computational methods face\nchallenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands,\nwhile current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision\nand generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge\n(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial\nand target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve\ngeometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge\nderived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric\nstates. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target\ngeometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition\nkernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB\nframework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more\ndetailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we\nconduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve\njoint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the\nunderlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.\nExperimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB\nsurpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for\naccurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges\nwith improved accuracy and applicability.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

A key difficulty is that\nmuch of an optimizer's behavior is implicitly determined by complex oscillatory\ndynamics, referred to as the \"edge of stability.\" The main contribution of this\npaper is to show that an optimizer's implicit behavior can be explicitly\ncaptured by a \"central flow:\" a differential equation which models the\ntime-averaged optimization trajectory. We show that these flows can empirically\npredict long-term optimization trajectories of generic neural networks with a\nhigh degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these flows, we reveal for\nthe first time 1) the precise sense in which RMSProp adapts to the local loss\nlandscape, and 2) an \"acceleration via regularization\" mechanism, wherein\nadaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards low-curvature regions in which\nthey can take larger steps. This mechanism is key to the efficacy of these\nadaptive optimizers. Overall, we believe that central flows constitute a\npromising tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

In this paper, we find that the performance\ndegradation is due to a phenomenon called Length Collapse, where longer text\nembeddings collapse into a narrow space. This collapse results in a\ndistributional inconsistency between embeddings of different text lengths,\nultimately hurting the performance of downstream tasks. Theoretically, by\nconsidering the self-attention mechanism inherently functions as a low-pass\nfilter, we prove that long sequences increase the attenuation rate of the\nlow-pass filter effect of the self-attention mechanism. With layers going\ndeeper, excessive low-pass filtering causes the token signals to retain only\ntheir Direct-Current (DC) component, which means the input token feature maps\nwill collapse into a narrow space, especially in long texts. Based on the above\nanalysis, we propose to mitigate the undesirable length collapse limitation by\nintroducing a temperature in softmax(), which achieves a higher low-filter\nattenuation rate. The tuning-free method, called TempScale, can be plugged into\nmultiple transformer-based embedding models. Empirically, we demonstrate that\nTempScale can improve existing embedding models, especially on long text\ninputs, bringing up to 0.53% performance gains on 40 datasets from Massive Text\nEmbedding Benchmark (MTEB) and 0.82% performance gains on 4 datasets from\nLongEmbed, which specifically focuses on long context retrieval.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

Our results validate the superiority\nof LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized\nDIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly\noutperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully\npreserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and\nthey also possess high transferability across different images as well as\nrestoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing\nimage reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior\n(in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in\nthis setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is\ndemonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"87"}]}

We construct a mapping from\nthe correlation functions of the scattered photons to those of a correlated\ninsulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Hubbard\nmodel at half-filling. We show how frequency filtering before photodetection\nplays a crucial role in determining this mapping.

We show\nthat if for an infinite family of quantum states stabilizer rank is lower than\na constant independent of system size, then stabilizer fidelity is lower\nbounded by an absolute constant. Using a result of \\cite{grewal2022low}, one of\nthe implications of this result is that low approximate stabilizer rank states\nare not pseudo-random.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"85"}]}

Accurate measurements of the FIR at the top of the\natmosphere are crucial for improving climate models. Current instruments are\ninsufficient, necessitating the development of advanced computational\ntechniques. To ensure the quality of the mission data, an End-to-End Simulator\n(E2ES) was developed to simulate the measurement process and evaluate the\neffects of instrument characteristics and environmental factors.

This problem is ill-posed and regularization techniques are\nnecessary. In this work, we present a novel and fast data-driven approach to\napproximate the inverse mapping. In the first phase, we generate an initial\napproximation of the inverse mapping using only simulated FORUM data. In the\nsecond phase, we improve this approximation by introducing climatological data\nas a priori information and using a neural network to estimate the optimal\nregularization parameters. While our approach does not match the precision of\nfull-physics retrieval methods, its key advantage is the ability to deliver\nresults almost instantaneously, making it highly suitable for real-time\napplications. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide more accurate a\npriori estimates for full-physics methods, thereby improving the overall\naccuracy of the retrieved atmospheric profiles.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"88"}]}

By considering the column energy balance, a\ncomprehensive linear response function (CLRF) forimportant climate variables\nand feedback quantities such as moist static energy, sea surface temperature,\nalbedo, cloud optical depth, and lapse rate is learned from Green's function\ndata. The learned CLRF delineates the effects of the energy diffusion in both\nthe ocean and atmosphere and the pattern-aware feedbacks from the\naforementioned radiatively active processes. The CLRF can then be decomposed\ninto forcing-response mode pairs which are in turn used to construct a\nreduced-order model (ROM) describing the dominant dynamics of climate\nresponses. These mode pairs capture nonlocal effects and teleconnections in the\nclimate and thus, make the ROM apt for capturing regional features of climate\nchange response. A key observation is that the CLRF captures the polar\namplified response as the most excitable mode of the climate system and this\nmode is explainable in the data-learned pattern-aware feedback framework. The\nROM can be used for predicting the response for a given forcing and for\nreconstructing the forcing from a given response; we demonstrate these\ncapabilities for independent forcing pattern.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

The coarse temporal\nresolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructs\nthe atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known.\nThe model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourier\nneural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather prediction\nand other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulated\nAFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolation\ntarget time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operation\ninside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can be\nused to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between two\ntime steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 h\nresolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishable\nfrom the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSE\nloss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared to\nlinear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce the\nstatistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves better\nthan 6 h resolution data. The ModAFNO layer is generic and is expected to be\napplicable to other problems, including weather forecasting with tunable lead\ntime.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

An important open question is whether AI models can\nextrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger,\nunseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI\nmodel FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category\n3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North\nAtlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet\non 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy\nfor global weather, but the one trained without Category 3-5 TCs cannot\naccurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot\nextrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3-5 TCs\nin one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin,\nsuggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins.

The datasets adopted in this\nstudy includes the meteorological parameters collected at the local weather\nstations at the site and in the Lenghu Town, the sky brightness at the local\nzenith acquired by the Sky Quality Meters and night sky all-sky images from a\ndigital camera, the ERA5 reanalysis database and global climate monitoring\ndata. From 2019 to 2023, the fractional observable time of photometric\ncondition is 69.70%, 74.97%, 70.26%, 74.27% and 65.12%, respectively. The\nfractional observing time is inversely correlated with surface air temperature,\nrelative humidity, precipitable water vapor, and dew temperature, demonstrating\nthat the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological\nparameters. Large-scale air-sea interactions affect the climate at Lenghu site,\nwhich in fact delivers a clue to understand the irregularity of 2023.\nSpecifically, precipitable water vapor at Lenghu site is correlated to both the\nwesterly wind index and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, the yearly\naverage temperature of Lenghu site is observed to increase significantly during\nthe occurrence of a strong El Ni\\~no event and the relative humidity anomaly at\nLenghu site is correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The\ndecrease of fractional observing time in 2023 was due to the ongoing strong El\nNi\\~no event and relevant global climate change.

We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment\nmetrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify\nrepresentations that develop throughout learning and determine if\nrepresentations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual\ncomputations.

We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend\nbeyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA\nin modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs,\nmay not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden\nstates. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability\nto detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing\ncomputations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

Both methods reach\ntheir limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not\nsufficiently separated or even overlap.\n  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages\nof the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency\ninformation as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift\nmethod instead of the much slower simulated annealing.\n  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance,\nmeasured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not\nonly on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit\nrecordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.\n  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the\nexisting approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data.

This work\naddresses this gap by investigating the impact of packing on the performance of\nstatic machine learning-based models used for malware detection and\nclassification, with a particular focus on those using visualisation\ntechniques. To this end, we present a comprehensive analysis of various packing\ntechniques and their effects on the performance of machine learning-based\ndetectors and classifiers. Our findings highlight the limitations of current\nstatic detection and classification systems and underscore the need to be\nproactive to effectively counteract the evolving tactics of malware authors.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"85"}]}

This technique is often\nused for online performance optimization and automated crash recovery in\ncertain mission-critical applications. However, the technique has been\nmisappropriated by malware creators to bypass signature-based detection\nmeasures instituted by anti-malware engines. However, current code mutation\nengines used by threat actors offer only a limited degree of mutation, which is\nfrequently detectable via static code analysis.

Effective detection of malicious transactions is crucial to maintaining\nthe security and integrity of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Existing malicious\ntransaction detection methods rely on large amounts of labeled data and suffer\nfrom low generalization. Label-efficient and generalizable malicious\ntransaction detection remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose\nShadowEyes, a novel malicious transaction detection method. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a generalized graph structure named TxGraph as a representation\nof malicious transaction, which captures the interaction features of each\nmalicious account and its neighbors. Then we carefully design a data\naugmentation method tailored to simulate the evolution of malicious\ntransactions to generate positive pairs. To alleviate account label scarcity,\nwe further design a graph contrastive mechanism, which enables ShadowEyes to\nlearn discriminative features effectively from unlabeled data, thereby\nenhancing its detection capabilities in real-world scenarios. We conduct\nextensive experiments using public datasets to evaluate the performance of\nShadowEyes. The results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods in four typical scenarios. Specifically, in the zero-shot learning\nscenario, it can achieve an F1 score of 76.98% for identifying gambling\ntransactions, surpassing the SOTA method by12.05%. In the scenario of\nacross-platform malicious transaction detection, ShadowEyes maintains an F1\nscore of around 90%, which is 10% higher than the SOTA method.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"88"}]}

Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks\nand performing well in general coding tests. However, these tests do not assess\nLLMs' ability to handle data science tasks in medicine, nor do they explore\ntheir practical utility in clinical research. To address this, we developed a\ndataset consisting of 293 real-world data science coding tasks, based on 39\npublished clinical studies, covering 128 tasks in Python and 165 tasks in R.\nThis dataset simulates realistic clinical research scenarios using patient\ndata. Our findings reveal that cutting-edge LLMs struggle to generate perfect\nsolutions, frequently failing to follow input instructions, understand target\ndata, and adhere to standard analysis practices. Consequently, LLMs are not yet\nready to fully automate data science tasks. We benchmarked advanced adaptation\nmethods and found two to be particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting,\nwhich provides a step-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 60%\nimprovement in code accuracy; and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to iteratively\nrefine their code, yielding a 38% accuracy improvement. Building on these\ninsights, we developed a platform that integrates LLMs into the data science\nworkflow for medical professionals. In a user study with five medical doctors,\nwe found that while LLMs cannot fully automate coding tasks, they significantly\nstreamline the programming process.

Two\ndominant approaches in this field are AutoRegressive (AR) models and Diffusion\nModels (DMs). However, genomic sequences are functionally heterogeneous,\nconsisting of multiple connected regions (e.g., Promoter Regions, Exons, and\nIntrons) where elements within each region come from the same probability\ndistribution, but the overall sequence is non-homogeneous. This heterogeneous\nnature presents challenges for a single model to accurately generate genomic\nsequences. In this paper, we analyze the properties of AR models and DMs in\nheterogeneous genomic sequence generation, pointing out crucial limitations in\nboth methods: (i) AR models capture the underlying distribution of data by\nfactorizing and learning the transition probability but fail to capture the\nglobal property of DNA sequences. (ii) DMs learn to recover the global\ndistribution but tend to produce errors at the base pair level. To overcome the\nlimitations of both approaches, we propose a post-training sampling method,\ntermed Absorb & Escape (A&E) to perform compositional generation from AR models\nand DMs. This approach starts with samples generated by DMs and refines the\nsample quality using an AR model through the alternation of the Absorb and\nEscape steps. To assess the quality of generated sequences, we conduct\nextensive experiments on 15 species for conditional and unconditional DNA\ngeneration. The experiment results from motif distribution, diversity checks,\nand genome integration tests unequivocally show that A&E outperforms\nstate-of-the-art AR models and DMs in genomic sequence generation.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

The m6A RNA methylation is a\nconserved and dynamically reversible mechanism controlling gene expression in a\nmyriad of biological processes. The role of m6A methylation in sexual\nmaturation, however, has remained largely unexplored and has never been studied\nin Atlantic salmon. While the maturation process is known to be affected by\nmany genetic and environmental factors, the molecular mechanisms causing\nvariation in the timing of maturation are still poorly understood. Hence,\ninvestigation of whether a widespread mechanism like m6A methylation could be\ninvolved in controlling of the maturation timing is warranted. In salmon, two\ngenes, also associated with age at maturity in humans, vgll3 and six6, have\nbeen shown to play an important role in maturation timing. In this study, we\ninvestigated the expression of 16 genes involved in the regulation of m6A RNA\nmethylation in the hypothalamus of Atlantic salmon with different homozygous\ncombinations of late and early alleles for vgll3 and six6 genes. We found\ndifferential expression of ythdf2.2, an m6A reader promoting mRNA degradation,\nwith higher expression in six6*LL compared to other genotypes as well as in\nimmature compared to mature males. In addition, we found that the expression\nlevels of genes coding for an eraser, alkbh5, and for a reader, ythdf1, were\nhigher in the hypothalamus of females than in males across all the different\ngenotypes studied. However the total m6A levels between the whole hypothalamus\nof males and females were similar.

An effective satellite-ground\ninterconnection design can result in a stable constellation topology for LMCNs.\nA naive solution is accessing the satellite with the longest remaining service\ntime (LRST), which is widely used in previous designs. The Coordinated\nSatellite-Ground Interconnecting (CSGI), the state-of-the-art algorithm,\ncoordinates the establishment of ground-satellite links (GSLs). Compared with\nexisting solutions, it reduces latency by 19% and jitter by 70% on average.\nHowever, CSGI only supports the scenario where terminals access only one\nsatellite and cannot fully utilize the multi-access capabilities of terminals.\nAdditionally, CSGI's high computational complexity poses deployment challenges.\nTo overcome these problems, we propose the Classification-based Longest\nRemaining Service Time (C-LRST) algorithm. C-LRST supports the actual scenario\nwith multi-access capabilities. It adds optional paths during routing with low\ncomputational complexity, improving end-to-end communications quality. We\nconduct our 1000s simulation from Brazil to Lithuania on the open-source\nplatform Hypatia. Experiment results show that compared with CSGI, C-LRST\nreduces the latency and increases the throughput by approximately 60% and 40%,\nrespectively. In addition, C-LRST's GSL switching number is 14, whereas CSGI is\n23. C-LRST has better link stability than CSGI.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"85"}]}

This paper presents how to exploit femtosecond selective\nlaser etching (SLE) techniques to manufacture truly three-dimensional (3D)\ncomponents. To demonstrate the micron-scale accuracy and repeatability of this\nprocess from the mm- to the cm-size range, various devices are designed and\nfabricated: fiber hole arrays with different hole densities, sizes,\norientations, and shapes; and fiber V-groove arrays. Additionally, a mechanical\nflexural fiber mount is presented as an example of how multiple functionalities\ncan be monolithically integrated into a single piece of glass through SLE\ntechnology. An example of a passive alignment substrate for optical components\nis also shown. SLE technique represents a new advancement in the field of\nmicroscale manufacturing, enabling the scalable production of custom-designed\nULE glass structures with unprecedented precision and complexity, paving the\nway for the miniaturized integration of highly stable components.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

Thus,\nharvesting low-frequency flows is a young concept compared to solar and wind\npowers, where triboelectric nanogenerators have been revealed as the most\npromising relevant actors. However, despite widespread attempts by researchers,\nthe drop energy harvesters' output power is still low, mainly because of the\nlimitations in candidates endowed with ideal triboelectric and wetting\nproperties and also the non-optimal and centimetre-scale device architecture\nthat prevents the conversion of the complete kinetic energy of impinging drops.\nHerein, we disclose a microscale triboelectric nanogenerator that can harvest a\nhigh density of electrical power from drops through a single, submillisecond,\nlong-lasting step. The mechanism relies on an instantaneous electrical\ncapacitance variation owing to the high-speed contact of the drops with the\nelectrodes' active area.

The\ncapacitive and microscale structure of the device is endowed with a small form\nfactor that allows for the production of densely packed arrays.

However, the transition toward clean and renewable\nenergy applications and the actualization of H2 economy require an efficient H2\nstorage medium. Material-based H2 storage is a viable option, as liquefaction\nand storage under pressure require ultra-low temperature (-253{\\deg}C) and\ntremendously high pressure (700 atm), respectively. In this work, we highlight\nthe exceptional H2 storage capabilities of recently synthesized boron monoxide\n(BO) monolayer functionalized with light metals (Li, Na, K, and Ca). Our\ncomputational approach, employing density functional theory (DFT), ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD), and thermodynamic analysis, reveals promising\nresults. We found that up to four metal dopants (Li, Na, K, and Ca) can be\nadsorbed onto BO monolayer with significantly strong binding energies.\nImportantly, these bindings surpass the cohesive counterparts of the parental\nmetal bulks, consequently stabilizing the crystal integrities, as confirmed by\nAIMD simulations. Each metal dopant on BO efficiently adsorbs multiple H2\nmolecules through electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Interestingly,\nthe metal-functionalized BO monolayers exhibit exceptionally high H2\ngravimetric capacities up to 11.75 wt%. These promising capacities exceed the\n5.50 wt% target set by the US Department of Energy for 2025.

In this paper, we introduce Structure Language\nModeling (SLM) as a novel framework for efficient protein conformation\ngeneration. Specifically, the protein structures are first encoded into a\ncompact latent space using a discrete variational auto-encoder, followed by\nconditional language modeling that effectively captures sequence-specific\nconformation distributions. This enables a more efficient and interpretable\nexploration of diverse ensemble modes compared to existing methods. Based on\nthis general framework, we instantiate SLM with various popular LM\narchitectures as well as proposing the ESMDiff, a novel BERT-like structure\nlanguage model fine-tuned from ESM3 with masked diffusion. We verify our\napproach in various scenarios, including the equilibrium dynamics of BPTI,\nconformational change pairs, and intrinsically disordered proteins. SLM\nprovides a highly efficient solution, offering a 20-100x speedup than existing\nmethods in generating diverse conformations, shedding light on promising\navenues for future research.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}

Treatment outcomes are\ntherefore significantly impacted by the optimization of therapeutic scheduling.\nPrevious preclinical research has suggested scheduling bevacizumab in sequence\nwith combination antiproliferatives could significantly improve clinical\noutcomes. Mathematical modeling is a well-suited tool for investigating this\nproposed scheduling modification. To address this critical need, individual\npatient tumor data from 11 clinical trials in NSCLC has been collated and used\nto develop a semi-mechanistic model of NSCLC growth and response to the various\ntherapeutics represented in those trials. Precise estimates of clinical\nparameters fundamental to cancer modeling have been produced - such as the rate\nof acquired resistance to various pharmaceuticals, the relationship between\ndrug concentration and cancer cell death, as well as the fine temporal dynamics\nof vascular remodeling in response to bevacizumab. In a reserved portion of the\ndataset, this model was used to predict the efficacy of individual treatment\ntime courses with a mean error rate of 59.7% after a single tumor measurement\nand 11.7% after three successive tumor measurements. A delay of 9.6 hours\nbetween pemetrexed-cisplatin and bevacizumab administration is predicted to\noptimize the benefit of sequential administration. At this gap, approximately\n93.5% of simulated patients benefited from a gap in sequential administration\ncompared with concomitant administration. Of those simulated patients, the mean\nimprovement in tumor reduction was 20.7%. This result suggests that scheduling\na modest gap between the administration of bevacizumab and its partner\nantiproliferatives could meaningfully improve patient outcomes in NSCLC.\n                "},{"role":"assistant","content":"92"}]}
